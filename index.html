<h3>About me:</h3>I am an undergraduate at Cairo University (faculty of Biomedical Engineering), Egypt. I am extremely passionate about Front-End Web Development and would love to gain as much
knowledge as possible in order to be able to pursue a career in this field. I participated in several events and trainings such as taking part in the 8th Undergraduate
Engineering Mathematics Research Forum which took place at Cairo University and won first place. <details> <summary>See More</summary>
Moreover, I trained at baheya hospital that is specialized in breast cancer and gained knowledge about the calibration and
maintenance of the medical devices(A picture of the certificate is shown below). Lastly, I completed several projects considering
Web Development, Machine Learning and Databases.<br>

<li><h1>Machine Learning:</h1><h3 class = "subtitles1">Predicting the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients.</h3>
    <pre>
I participated in creating a model that predicts the likeability of patients to have a cardiovascular disease within ten years given 15 factors using the following steps:

<i id = "note"><u>Note</u></i>: the dataset is from <b>kaggle</b>.
        <ol>
            <li>Distiguishing Quantitative and Categorical columns in the dataset.</li>
            <li>Applying label encoding to the categorical columns in the dataset(data cleaning).</li>
            <li>Removing the outliers from the dataset by using a +-1.5 threshold(data cleaning).</li>
            <li>Standardizing the Quantitative columns(calculating the z-score).</li>
            <li>Filling the missing data with the mean of each feature.</li>
            <li>Noticing the depedancies of the features with respect to each other using <b>Heat Map</b> and getting rid of some of these features.</li>
            <li>Splitting the data into training data(80%) and testing data(20%).</li>
            <li>Calculating the Null and Alternative Hypotheses using <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> for Quantitative features and <b>Chi-square test</b> for Categorical features.</li>
            <li>Implementing the Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch and comparing my result with the standard python package.</li>
            <li>Both gave me the same result of 88.7% accuracy which makes the model highly accurate and trustful.</li>
        </ol>

<li><h1>Web Development:</h1><h3 class = "subtitles2">Admin of the Prosthetics Department in a hospital.</h3>
    <pre>
        <ol>
        <li>It consists of ten frames which are Login, Home, Suppliers, Doctors, Patients, Prosthetics, Orders, Operations, Supplied by and Logout.</li>
        <li>I added various validations to prevent error, enhance both security and user experience and avoid data loss. For an example, the Login page will not be directed
to the home page unless the user entered the correct username and password. To add, when creating a new record in any of the tables, all of the fields must be filled 
with the correct data types.</li>
        <li>I also made sure to link the tables to each other using foreign keys. To elaborate, the operations table has the doctor, patient and the prosthetic required for each
operation as foreign keys attributes linked to the doctors, patients and prosthetics databases. As a result, the drop-down list that appears when updating an existing 
record or creating a new record contains only the information that is present in the other tables.</li>
        <li> I added a search bar that searches based on the name.</li>
